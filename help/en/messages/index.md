# Operator Messages

During operation the program may show pop-up messages to the operator:

- End-of-program window with runtime info and an OK button.  
- G-code transmission-error window with **"Skip"** (continue) and **"Abort"** buttons.  
- Warning on attempting to close the program while G-code is still being transmitted.  
- Confirmation window when sending parser-setup commands after a long-press of the **"Send"** button in the **"G-code program"** window, if the option **"Automatically set parser state before sending from selected line"** is enabled in program settings.  
- Other auxiliary dialogs.
