# Translation file

Each extension may provide a translation file for its UI strings.  
The filename format is:

```
translation_xx.qm
```

where **xx** is the two‑letter language code.

Compiled `.qm` files are produced from source `.ts` files using Qt Linguist or the `lrelease` command that ships with the Qt framework.

For details on creating translation files, see the Qt documentation:  
[Qt Linguist Manual](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtlinguist-index.html).
