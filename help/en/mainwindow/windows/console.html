<p>For manual CNC control, as well as for configuring and displaying controller status information, the <strong>"Console"</strong> window is provided.</p>
<p class="center"><img src="../../img/console.png" alt="Window Console"></p>
<p>At the bottom of the window there is a command‑entry field and two buttons: <strong>Send Command</strong> and <strong>Clear Console</strong>. At the top a multiline output area shows replies from the controller.</p>
<p>To send a command to the CNC controller, type it into the entry field and press the <strong>Enter</strong> key or click <strong>Send Command</strong>. After the controller processes the command, the command and its reply are displayed above in the following format:</p>
<p class="center"><strong>Command &lt; Response</strong></p>
<p>If the program setting <em>"Show UI commands"</em> is enabled, all commands sent to the controller by toolbar controls will appear in the output area. When <em>"Show G‑code program commands"</em> is turned on, every command from the CP that is transmitted to the controller will also be shown.</p>
<p>The output field can be cleared by clicking <strong>Clear Console</strong>.</p>
