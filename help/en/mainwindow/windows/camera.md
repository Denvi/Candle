View navigation inside the window is performed by holding the left mouse button (LMB) and moving the cursor in the desired direction; zooming is controlled with the mouse wheel.

The window contains reticle elements: a vertical line, a horizontal line, and a circle whose centre lies at the intersection of the two lines. The intersection point can be moved by pressing LMB while holding the **Shift** key on the keyboard and dragging the cursor in the desired direction.

Parameters such as camera image resolution, color and thickness of the reticle elements are available in the programâ€™s settings window.
