<p>The image from the camera connected to the PC is displayed in the <strong>"Camera"</strong> window.</p>
<p class="center"><img src="../../img/camera.png" alt="Window Camera"></p>
<p>View navigation inside the window is performed by holding the left mouse button (LMB) and moving the cursor in the desired direction; zooming is controlled with the mouse wheel.</p>
<p>The window contains reticle elements: a vertical line, a horizontal line, and a circle whose centre lies at the intersection of the two lines. The intersection point can be moved by pressing LMB while holding the <strong>Shift</strong> key on the keyboard and dragging the cursor in the desired direction.</p>
<p>Parameters such as camera image resolution, color and thickness of the reticle elements are available in the program’s settings window.</p>
<p>Window "Camera" is unavailable in Mac OS X.</p>
