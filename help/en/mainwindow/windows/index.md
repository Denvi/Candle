# Windows

Each window has a title area containing the window name, "Detach", and "Close" buttons; the content area holds input elements, information displays, and toolbars.

All windows except the "G‑code program" can be moved by dragging the left mouse button (LMB) on their title bar. While moving, the main window’s layout updates dynamically to indicate the future position of the dragged window.

Windows may be detached from the main window by clicking the "Detach" button in the title bar and closed via the "Close" button. Detached windows can be re‑attached to the main window by dragging their title; closed windows can be reopened through the corresponding item in the main menu **View ▸ Windows**.

Window sizes are changed by pressing LMB on the border of a window and dragging it in the desired direction.
