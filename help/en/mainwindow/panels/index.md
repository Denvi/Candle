# Panels

Instrument panels containing controls and status information of the CNC are located in the **"Device"**, **"Modification"**, and **"User"** windows.

The name of each window indicates the functional purpose of the panels it contains, but this does not restrict their composition – all panels can be freely moved both within a given window and between windows.

Movement is performed by dragging a panel’s title bar with LMB. While dragging, the window shows the future position of the panel as a blue line.

Most instrument panels are collapsible to save screen space. In the expanded state a panel’s header displays a "‑" sign to its left; in the collapsed state it shows a "≡". Panels can be collapsed or expanded by clicking their title bar with LMB.

Header text is normally black, but when critical functions of a panel are activated it turns red.

At program startup some panels appear inactive and become active only after the CNC is connected to the PC.
