# Panel "User commands"

![Panel User commands](../../img/usercommands.png)

To extend program functionality for CNC control, a **User commands** panel is provided.
Each button on the panel sends pre‑defined commands to the GRBL controller when pressed.

Command configuration occurs in the program’s **Settings** window.  Within the *User commands* group, a table lists each command and allows you to:

- Add, delete or reorder commands.
- Set a tooltip shown when hovering over the button.
- Assign an icon to the button.
- Define command code.

The program includes a limited set of icons; additional user‑defined icons can be added by selecting `...` item from the icon selection dropdown.

A command code may consist of a single or multiple G‑code lines, or script.

For a full discussion of using script within the program, see [Scripting](qthelp://candle.en/html/scripting/index.html) in this manual.
