<h1 id="panels">Panels</h1>
<p>Instrument panels containing controls and status information of the CNC are located in the <strong>"Device"</strong>, <strong>"Modification"</strong>, and <strong>"User"</strong> windows.</p>
<p>The name of each window indicates the functional purpose of the panels it contains, but this does not restrict their composition – all panels can be freely moved both within a given window and between windows.</p>
<p>Movement is performed by dragging a panel’s title bar with LMB. While dragging, the window shows the future position of the panel as a blue line.</p>
<p>Most instrument panels are collapsible to save screen space. In the expanded state a panel’s header displays a "‑" sign to its left; in the collapsed state it shows a "≡". Panels can be collapsed or expanded by clicking their title bar with LMB.</p>
<p>Header text is normally black, but when critical functions of a panel are activated it turns red.</p>
<p>At program startup some panels appear inactive and become active only after the CNC is connected to the PC.</p>
