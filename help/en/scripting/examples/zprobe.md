# Z-probe

A common example of zeroing the Z-axis.  
Since probing may occur while a program is running (e.g. after a tool change), the script saves and later restores the CNCâ€™s operating modes.

The offset from the actual tool position to the surface after probing can be baked into the G92 command.  
In this sample the offset is assumed to be zero.

```js
// Save current parser state (absolute/relative positioning, planes, units, etc.)
app.device.storeParserState();

// Run the precision surface-probe cycle:
app.device.sendCommands([
    "G21G91",        // 1. Switch to relative positioning (G91) and metric units (G21)
    "G38.2Z-30F100", // 2. Fast probe: plunge 30 mm at 100 mm/min
    "G0Z1",          // 3. Retract 1 mm after first touch
    "G38.2Z-2F10",   // 4. Slow probe: move another 2 mm at 10 mm/min
    "G92Z0",         // 5. Set current Z position as the new zero (zero Z)
    "G91G0Z5"        // 6. Safe retract: lift 5 mm above the new zero
]);

// Wait until all commands are executed and acknowledged
app.device.waitResponses();

// Restore original parser state
app.device.restoreParserState();
```
