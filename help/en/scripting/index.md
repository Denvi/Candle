# Scripting

To extend the applicationâ€™s functionality, tools for creating and running scripts are provided.

Scripts are written in JavaScript (ECMAScript, [ECMA-262](https://ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-262/)).
For details, see the guide: [ECMAScript Reference](https://doc.qt.io/archives/qt-5.15/ecmascript.html).

Scripts can be used:

- In the **Script window**, which lets you load, edit, run, debug, and save script code.
- Inside **User commands** (see [User Commands](qthelp://candle.en/html/mainwindow/panels/usercommands.html)).
- In **plugins** (see [Script File](qthelp://candle.en/html/plugins/script.html)).

This section covers:

- Preparing, running, and debugging scripts.
- Table of available object.
- Table of additional classes.
- Examples.
