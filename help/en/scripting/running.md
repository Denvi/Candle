# Running and debugging

To run a script, click the **Start** button in the programâ€™s **Script** window.

If the code from the previous section is entered correctly, a dialog asking for a travel value will appear after launch.

Enter any value and confirm it by clicking **OK**.  
Pressing **Cancel** terminates the script without further action.

The tool should move by the specified distance.

For step-by-step verification, run the script in debug mode (click **Debug**).  
A debugger window will open, showing the script code and the usual controls found in other integrated development environments.

Once the script works correctly, you can move it into a user command or use it in an extension.
