# Executing the control program

Start execution by pressing the **"Send"** button in the **"G-code program"** window.

After clicking **"Send"**, the **"State"** panel should show **"Run"**.

When finished, a message window will appear.

During execution the following commands are available:

- **"Pause"** in the **"G-code program"** window – pauses sending G-code to the controller.  
- **"Abort"** in the same window – stops sending G-code to the controller.  
- **"Hold"** on the **"Control"** panel – instantly pauses command execution by the controller (unlike **"Pause"**). While on hold, the **"Spindle on/off"** button on the **"Spindle"** panel is also available. Resume by pressing **"Hold"** again.  
- **"Reset"** on the **"Control"** panel – instantly stops command execution and halts G-code transmission.  
- Feed-rate, rapid-traverse, and spindle-speed override via the **"Overriding"** panel.
