<h1 id="loading-the-control-program">Loading the control program</h1>
<p>As an example we will use the PCB track-milling G-code, because it touches most of the programâ€™s features.</p>
<p>Load the G-code via the <strong>"Open"</strong> command in the <strong>"File"</strong> menu or by clicking the <strong>"Open"</strong> button in the <strong>"G-code program"</strong> window. After selecting the file and confirming, the <strong>"Visualizer"</strong> window will show the toolpath, machining boundaries, and estimated runtime.</p>
<p>Preparation for running the G-code includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clamping the workpiece on the table (for milling it is usually placed on a <strong>"sacrificial"</strong> table).</li>
<li>Homing the machine (<strong>"Home"</strong> button on the <strong>"Control"</strong> panel).</li>
<li>Installing the tool.</li>
<li>Setting the work coordinate system zero.</li>
</ul>
<p>Use the <strong>"Jog"</strong> panel buttons to position the tool at the desired X and Y zero point on the workpiece, then zero the work coordinates for X and Y.</p>
<p>Note: you can zero the work zero either with the axis-zero buttons on the <strong>"User Commands"</strong> panel or on the <strong>"Coordinate System"</strong> panel.</p>
<ul>
<li>With <strong>"User Commands"</strong>, work coordinates are <strong>NOT</strong> restored after a controller reset or emergency stop.</li>
<li>With <strong>"Coordinate System"</strong>, values are stored in non-volatile memory and survive power cycles.</li>
</ul>
<p>The user decides, but it is recommended to use the <strong>"Coordinate System"</strong> panel for X and Y; for Z you may use <strong>"User Commands"</strong>, because Z depends on the current tool length and is usually set immediately before running the G-code.</p>
<p>Set the Z work zero manually (as with X and Y) or by using the probe command on the <strong>"User Commands"</strong> panel. Connect and configure the probe according to the CNC machine manual.</p>
