<p>Because PCB milling is performed at depths of a few hundredths of a millimetre, it is recommended to first scan the surface irregularities and modify the original G-code accordingly.</p>
<p>Required steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure the Z work zero is on the surface of the workpiece.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>"Create"</strong> button on the <strong>"Heightmap"</strong> panel.</li>
<li>Click <strong>"Auto"</strong> to set the map boundaries; ensure the G-code stays within them.</li>
<li>Define the height-map reference point. You will have to re-zero Z at this exact point before running the G-code. If several G-codes are used for one workpiece, make sure this point remains probe-accessible after intermediate operations.</li>
<li>Configure the probing grid: set the number of probe points (e.g. 3 × 4), safe Z height (Zt = 5), probe depth (Zb = –1), and feed rate (F = 50).</li>
<li>Configure the interpolation grid; values should be at least 10× the number of probe points. This affects machining accuracy on the workpiece surface.</li>
<li>Press the <strong>"Probe"</strong> button in the <strong>"Heightmap"</strong> window and wait for the probing to finish.</li>
<li>If several G-codes are used for the same workpiece, save the map via <strong>"File ▸ Save"</strong> while the height-map editor is open. For subsequent G-codes load the saved map with the <strong>"Open"</strong> button on the <strong>"Heightmap"</strong> panel.</li>
<li>Press <strong>"Edit"</strong> on the <strong>"Heightmap"</strong> panel to exit the editor.</li>
<li>Enable the <strong>"Use heightmap"</strong> flag to modify the G-code.</li>
<li>Set the Z work zero for the obtained height map: raise the tool to a safe height, press <strong>"Origin"</strong> on the <strong>"Heightmap"</strong> panel to move to the reference XY point, then set Z manually or with the probe command from <strong>"User Commands"</strong>.</li>
</ul>
